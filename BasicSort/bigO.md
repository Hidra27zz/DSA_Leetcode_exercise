# BigO

- Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sort all have O(n^2) time complexity.
- Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sort have O(1) space complexity. All three of these sort the array in place. That means that they do not create additional copies of the array. That means it the space complexity is O(1).
- Only Insertion Sort is O(n) when you start with sorted (or almost sorted) data.
